#  Debugging in the IDE, IntelliJ;

What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
```
To debug an application.
On the line we want our application to pause, and the debugger to kick in. Click in the grey bar on the point of the program that you want to pause. When it reaches the break point line, it will pause the application, and launch the debug window.
```


Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
```
No. Would need to step into to do that.
```

How do we debug the next line of code?
```
Step over: will run the line of code, and jump down to the next line of code. Where it will pause and wait, before it runs that.
```
What does the step into command do?
```
Step into: will go into the method wanting to be debugged, and it will go into that method (within the appropriate class), and pause at the top of that method.
```


What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
```
Evaluate expression: can insert a single method from the project in here to evaluate, and to return a result.
Code fragment: can run multiple lines of code and create variables to store things.
```
